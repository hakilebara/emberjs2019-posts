These don't have blog posts but it felt like they should be tracked somehow.
1. "I hope query params get some love in #EmberJS2019. Biggest pain point of the framework right now imo. At least as development goes." - [Robert Clancy](https://twitter.com/robboclancy/status/1133411097279696902)
1. "Here is my @emberjs blog post for #EmberJS2019 (in a tweet)! I start from the idea that 80% of apps don't need a full SPA to sprinkle in some client side niceties. What do I need from my tool belt?" - [Scott Newcomer](https://twitter.com/puekey/status/1135693033729454080)
1. "since I won't have time for a full blown blog post in the next few weeks here are some of my #Emberjs2019 thoughts as a Twitter thread:" - [Tobias Bieniek](https://twitter.com/TobiasBieniek/status/1135790015177469952)
1. "My wish for #EmberJS2019 is basically to slim the feature set down -
'There should be oneâ€“ and preferably only one â€“obvious way to do it.'" - [Ondrej Sevcik](https://twitter.com/ondrejsevcik/status/1138778957178974209)
1. "a few more thoughts on the #emberjs2019 topic: before thinking about what comes after Octane, let's finish and officially release Ember Octane first! (link: https://twitter.com/real_ate/status/1139092835154706432) twitter.com/real_ate/statuâ€¦ has similar thoughts" - [Tobias Bieniek](https://twitter.com/TobiasBieniek/status/1139100524014395394)
1. "Keep Routes as a concept but make it easier to experiment with alternative navigation schemes wherein there might not be such a thing as route (or whatever it is is unrecognizable from the classic Ember desktop navigation route)" - [Alex Matchneer](https://twitter.com/amatchneer/status/1139242398134018048)
